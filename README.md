You'll run the 'pod install' or 'pod update' commands from the root directory. Just look for a file named 'Podfile', where you find that is the 'root directory' in the commands listed below.

- If you don't have Cocoapods installed you can install with `gem install cocoapods`.
- After cloning the app for the first time on a machine run `pod install` in the root directory to install all linked pods.
- After pulling in new changes run `pod update` to make sure that everything is up to date.
